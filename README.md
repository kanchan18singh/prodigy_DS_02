# Titanic Dataset Analysis
## problem Statement :
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
Sample Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for machine learning and statistical analysis, containing information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following variables:
- **Survived**: Indicates whether a passenger survived or not (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger's name
- **Sex**: Passenger's sex
- **Age**: Passenger's age
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. This involves identifying missing values, handling outliers, exploring the relationships between variables, and identifying patterns and trends in the data.

## Tasks
1. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, handle outliers if necessary, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the relationships between variables, visualize distributions, and identify patterns and trends in the data.



## Instructions
To run the analysis:
1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `task-02.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Execute each cell in the notebook to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.

## Conclusion
The analysis aims to provide insights into the Titanic dataset, helping to understand factors that influenced survival rates among passengers.
